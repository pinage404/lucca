[Cozy][cozy] Lucca (Pagga) connector
=======================================

What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space. With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

What's this new konnector?
--------------------------

This connector fetches the PDF pay statements from the Lucca (Pagga) web site.

There is no parsing of the amounts or things like that at the moment and then no link is possible with bank operations at the moment.
